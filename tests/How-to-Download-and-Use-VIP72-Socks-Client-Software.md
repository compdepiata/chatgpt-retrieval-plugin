VIP72 Socks Client is a software that allows you to hide your IP address and access websites anonymously. It works by using a network of proxy servers and socks servers that encrypt your traffic and mask your real IP. You can choose from a large quantity of online socks and proxy servers from different countries and regions. VIP72 Socks Client also integrates with Proxifier, a software that allows you to route any application through a proxy or a chain of proxies.

6. Click on Connect button to activate the selected proxy or socks server. You will see a green icon next to it if it is connected successfully.
7. Open Proxifier and configure it to use the proxy or socks server that you connected with the Socks Client.

You can also create proxy chains by adding multiple proxies or socks servers.
8. Click on OK to save the settings and then click on Profile > Proxification Rules > Add... to create a rule for routing your applications through the proxy or socks server. You can specify which applications you want to proxify, which ports they use, and which proxy or socks server they should use.
